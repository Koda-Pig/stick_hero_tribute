This soundtrack is taken from [Heartbound](https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/). I don't own any rights to it, but it is free to use as per the steam page: _As long as you are not directly reuploading the music with no other content you are free to use the songs in this OST in any videos or streams whether they are monetized or not._
